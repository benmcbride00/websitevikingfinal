				<p>Eugene manages to heal the man but isn't sure at what cost. This magic is very hard to do perfectly and when he was taught it he was given a warning to be very careful cause the side affects may be brutal.</p>
				<p>"Let him sleep." said Eugene.</p>
				<p>The men let the sick man sleep and hope that he will be fully recovered the next morning. The next morning comes and the man still hasn't awoke, so they decide to leave the man be after checking to ensure he is still breathing.</p>
				<p>Suddenly they see another ship in the distance which is rushing towards their boat. Arrows start to fly from the boat, but Eugene manages to block the first set of arrows, quickly a second set of arrows comes flying towards them but Eugene isn't able to stop these arrows, some of the men in the convoy are hit by the arrows and are injured.
				Before the boat can reload their bows Eugene conjours a migthy spear and sends it flying towards the other boat and hits the bow of the boat causing there to be a huge hole in the boat letting water in. As the boat continues to sink, Eugene summons a beast from the depths of the ocean to finish of the boat and eat the rest of its crew before disappearing back into the ocean.</p>
				<p>"We're safe." Says Eugene.</p>
				<p>That night while all the convoy where sleeping and healing from their wonds that day, the man who Eugene had tried to heal awoke with a craze so bad he started to kill all the men while they slept, when he finally killed everyone except for Eugene he waited to Eugene awoke from his sleep before showing him what he had done then finally killing him before he had a chance to respond to the matter</p>
