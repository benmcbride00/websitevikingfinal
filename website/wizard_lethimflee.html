				<p>Eugene let the man flee back to the village, as he thought it would be a good idea to send a warnign back to the village that this will happen again if they send more men.</p>
				<p>"Was that a good idea?" asked Norris.</p>
				<p>"I hope so, they should see what will happen if they come aftre us again." replied Eugene.</p>
				<p>Eugene and his convoy continued on through the forest until they foudn somewhere to camp for the evening.</p>
				<p>Back in the Village, the leader returned to the village on his own and told the story of what had happened to his men and that Eugene and his convoy needed stopped before they caused any more havoc in the region. The leader of the town decided
				to gather a small army and go after Eugene and his convoy. They were kitted out with the strongest armour and best weapons the town had and sent on their way accompained by a wizard of their own whom they hoped could match Eugene's abilities. It would take them some time to catch up with the convoy but they were determined to do so.</p>
				<p>The next morning Eugene woke the camp early as he heard a roar come from the forest and continued hearing it come closer to them. He hurried his men to get ready to fight, but they weren't sure what it was they were going to be fighting, they just hoped they were strong enough to do so. A huge beast half gorilla, half giant spider, came crashing through the trees to where they were camped
				and stopped in it's tracks and started to growl at the convoy. The closest man to the beast un-sheathed his sword and swung he blade at the beast only for it to be caught in mid-air by the beast paw, ripped out of his hand and thrown away. Before the man could do anything he was ripped apart by the bare hands of the beast.</p>
				<p>Eugene now had to quickly make a decision, does he run and try to escape the beast, but it would be in the direction of the town, or does he try to kill the beast were it stands.</p>
