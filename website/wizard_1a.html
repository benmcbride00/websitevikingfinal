				<p>After travelling for 5 nights and 5 days Eugene and his convoy have finally reached Trondheim. The town where they can finally begin their journey. 
				"The first thing we must do is find somewhere to stay." stated Eugene.
				Everyone agreed with this, afterall they were knackered and eager to get rest before starting their jouney in the morning.
				Trondheim is known for its fantastic Inns so they was going to be no issua at all finding somewhere to stay. In fact they had heard about a particular inn called The Home. It was renowned for its hospitality towards wizards as many people where afraid of them.
				After settling for the night, Eugene created a loaf of bread and a canter of wine for each of his convoy out of thin air using very basic magic which he had been taught.
				Early the next morning they were awoke by a large crash outside their room.</p>
				<p>"What was that!" exclaimed the head of the convoy.</p>
				<p>"It sounded like a door being knocked down." stated Eugene who was now on edge.</p>
				<p>"We better leave quickly!" Said the convoy leader in a hurry.</p>
				<p>Quickly Eugene and the convoy left hoping that noone had followed them. They started into the forest on horses which they had bought the night before. Quickly they realised that they hadn't managed to get away without being spotted.
				In the distance behind them they could hear roars and shouts coming after them. They had suspected if they were found out it wouldn't go down well and this was the beginning of it. Eugene had been hoping for this, after all he did enjoy conflict.</p>
				<p>"Stop here" demanded Eugene.</p>
				<p>"What for? There are men chasing us!" Exclaimed Eugenes assistant Morris in a scared tone.</p>
				<p>"We're going to ambush them" Eugene said with a smurk.</p>
				<p>As the men came closer Eugene and his convoy hid in the trees either side of the rode. Most of the men in his convoy were well trained soldiers so Eugene had no worries about stopping the men chasing them.
				As the men from the town started to go past them Eugene jumped out wiht the rest of his comvoy setting a wall of fire infront of the men so they couldnt escape ahead of them, he then shout a bolt of lightening out of his hand which hit one of the men square in the chest sending him to the ground dead.
				The rest of the men wheere then picked off by Eugenes convoy with the leader of the group managing to escape fleeing on his horse back towards the town.</p>
				<p>Eugene had a decision to make.</p>
