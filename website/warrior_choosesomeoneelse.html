				<p>"Someone else will be chosen" shouted Ulfrik.</p>
				<p>He decided on the man who exposed the cheater, thinking that this man must have high morals to expose a cheater no matter how hard it may be. The man was a short man but seemed to be very strong and quite intelligent which Ulfrik seen to be a benefit to them.</p>
				<p>After choosing the new man they set off on their journey and sailed for what seems like weeks upon weeks until they finally come across a new land which they had hoped was England but soon found out it wasn't, they had actually travelled well past England and into a land full of people who seemed native to the land and spoke in a different tongue from Ulfrik and his crew</p>
				<p>"What should we do?" asked the new man.</p>
				<p>"I'm not sure." replied Ulfrik as they stared at the local men standing on the beach with their weapons ready.</p>
				<p>"I'll go talk to them" said the new man.</p>
				<p>Ulfrik and the rest of the crew watched as the man went over to talk to the men to try to understand who they were and what they wanted. Eventually the man returned having spoke to the men and explained that he tried to say they came in peace but it may have come across wrong. The men in the beach gestured for the crew to follow the men so they left their ship and followed the men to their village. Along the way they noticed the signs and hanging skeletons with warnings around the village 
				put there to keep intruders and unwanted guests from entering the village. Ulfrik found this disturbing and wasn't quite sure that they were doing the right thing but continued on anyways. Eventually they got to the village when Ulfrik realised he had a decision to make, he could stay the night but risk being killed or they could try and leave and may have to fight their way out of the village although they where outnumbered.</p>
