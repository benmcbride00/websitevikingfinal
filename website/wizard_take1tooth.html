				<p>Eugene takes 1 of the teeth and absorbes it power and feels a little bit of hate fill him as he does so. Thinking about it he's glad he didn't take the rest if this is what one tooth feels like. Although, he can feel the strength coursing through him now, he wonders what all of them would feel like.</p>
				<p>"I feel stronger" says Eugene.</p>
				<p>"We should carry on with our journey." says Morris</p>
				<p>Eugene and the surviving convoy continue with their journey and find the Island they are looking for, ahead in the cliff edge they see a cave which they progress towards and enter hoping that there are no beasts or people in the cave. Before they continue on their journey they decide to camp at the entrance to the cave as they don't know how long they'll be travelling for.
				The next morning after everyone had rose from their sleep they set off deeper into the cave in the hop they find what they are looking for. After traversing for 3 days thry finally find what seems to be a door, but isn't budging through the strength of the men. To get through this Eugene decides the best choice would be to blow the rock up which he does, and through the smoke a glow from the room can be seen. This is it, we've found it, thought Eugene.
				</p><p>Once the smoke settles and they can see into the well lit room they realise there are skeletons standing guard to what seems to be a book at the back of the room.</p>
				<p>"Prepare yourselves!" Shouts Eugene.</p>
				<p>The convoy of men unsheath their swords and stand to fight the skeletons. Quickly the skeltons advance and kill the first two of the men in the convoy, the rest of the men group together to fight the rest of the skeletons and eventually manage to destroy them all.</p>
				<p>As Eugene opens the book he is met with flames appearing from the book burning his face. Quickly he realises he isn't strong enough to read the book and from this knowledge goes insane and tries to kill the rest of the convoy. The convoy manage to strike Eugene before he has the chance to attack them and leave him in the cave lying unconsious on the floor.</p>
