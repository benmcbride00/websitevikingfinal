				<p>Eugene and his convoy flee from the beast in the direction of the town in the hope that they can circle back, lose the beast and then return to their journey.</p>
				<p>Eventually after running some distance the beast stopped chasing them and left in another direction. Although, at this point the convoy where very tired so decided to stop to rest and get some food, after-all they hadn't had a chance to eat yet.
				Eugene set up a camp fire and started to roast some squirels they captured the day before. They had planned to stop here for food then continue on their journey as quickly as possible.</p>
				<p>"Something doesn't feel right. I've a bad feeling." said Eugene.</p>
				<p>"What do you mean?" asked Norris</p>
				<p>"I can feel another mgically presence close by." replied Eugene.</p>
				<p>They passed the feeling off as a mythically beast and continued eating their lunch. As time passed Eugene grew increasingly more worried as the presence grew stronger, then eventually they started to hear the marching of men coming in their direction.
				It was the towns small army, this couldn't be good, espicially if they have another magic user with them which he suspected the feeling was coming from.</p>
				<p>"Up" Eugene whispered.
				</p><p>"There's people here." replied Norris.
				</p><p>"It's the towns people, I knew leaving him was a bad idea." retorted Eugene.
				</p><p>Eugene and his convoy sat slilently in the hope they wouldn't be noticed, but the wizard could sense Eugene as well and led them directly to the convoy. Eugene tried to surprise the small army with a bolt of fire but the wizard blocked the attack and stunned Eugene in the process giving the rest of the army time to move in on the convoy.
				The battle was a migthy one, the convoy fighting for their lives for the second time that day, but they were outmatched 7 - 1, they didn't stand a chance. Norris fell first with a blow to the arm then a swift cut across his neck. Eugene was still stunned and struggling to move and help his men all he could do was watch. Quickly the men started to fall one-by-one.
				The fought bravely but just didn't have the numbers to fight back. Eventually Eugene was able to move again, but by this point he was too late. With a strike lightening he took out 5 of the towns men, but was quickly rushed by other men whom he managed to evade swings of their axes from. The wizard from the town then tried to stop Eugene but he was no match for him.
				Eugene managed to stun the wizard and then swiftly kill him by sending a conjured spear through his chest, although while he was pre-occupied, the leader of the men drove a sword through the back of Eugene, sending him to the ground in pain. Eugene fell that day and never rose again.</p>
