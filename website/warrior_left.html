				<p>Ulfrik decides to take the left passageway, unsure as to where it leads. But the passageway was well lit so he was hoping it would lead to somewhere with plenty of treasure.</p>
				<p>The passageway seemed to be never ending, they were walking for what seemed like forever when they started to see light in the distance. As they got close to the light they realised it was the end of the passageway.</p>
				<p>"Finally" said Ulfrik.</p>
				<p>They rushed to the end of the passageway to see what was at the end. What they found was magnificent. A mighty castle that seemed to be empty. They slowly approached the castle as they were unsure if there were going to be people or beasts hiding inside the castle. When they got to the castle doors, they knocked on the door,
				noone answered, so they continued inside. As soon as they entered the castle they found many riches, piles of gold, trunks full of more gold scattered throughout the castle, they also found weapons and armour which were carved majestically. They even found mighty ships in the harbour of the castle which they decided to load all the ritches onto and take home with them. 
				Ulfrik and his crew returned home as the richest men in the land and eventually set up settlements with the gold they had brought home with them.</p>
