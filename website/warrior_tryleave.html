				<p>"Let's leave" said Ulfrik</p>
				<p>Ulfrik and his mean tried to leave the village, but the local people didn't seem to happy about it. Ulfrik tried to thank the village leader for their hospitality and tell him that they had to leave and explore. Although the village leader wasn't having this and ordered Ulfrik and his men to return to their food and sit down around the fire.
				The leader then went on to talk to his men in their native tongue which noone really understood from Ulfriks crew. Although it looked as if the leader was ordering his men to ensure that the crew didn't leave as they started to block the exits.
				</p><p>"We must leave now, get ready to fight" said Ulfrik to his men</p>
				<p>Ulfrik and his mean readied their weapons and told the leader of the village that if they were not allowed to leave at once they would kill every single one of them. The leader laughed and ordered his men to kill Ulfrik and his crew. Shortly, 3 of Ulfriks crew were killed and only a handful of the village men where killed, Ulfrik quickly realised that these men were formiddable fighters and he wasn't sure if they stood a chance of breaking free but it was too late now.
				They continued to fight for some time before more men were killed. Eventuallu Ulfrik was struck in the arm by a swing from the leader of the village where he dropped his axe in pain. Quickly the leader took this chance to slash at Ulfrik and wound him in the chest where he fell to the ground. Here the rest of the crew stopped fighting and quickly surrendered. Ulfrik and his men were taken as prisoners and used as farmers for the village people before dying some years later.
