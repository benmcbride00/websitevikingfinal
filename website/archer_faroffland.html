				<p>Ingrid decided to go to a far off land in search of the missing crew which left a few months before and never returned. This way she would earn more respect if they found the missing men.
				They set off on their journey early the next morning and enjoy songs and drink during the early part of their journey. Quickly the mood starts to change on the boat though when after 2 weeks of travelling there are no signs of land or any shipwrecks, in fact there is no sign of life at all where they are.</p>
				<p>"Are we nearly there yet." asked Ingrid.</p>
				<p>"We don't know we could be." replied the captain</p>
				<p>Soon a thick fog fell over the sea and quickly the crew couldn't see over the edge of the boat and had no idea what lay ahead of them. This lasted for another week, they just drifted forward not knowing where they would end up. Eventually the fog lifted and they could finally see land. What worried them the most was that they could see the ship which had went missing and never returned but there was noone to be seen on it.
				As they approached the land they noticed people on the beach, a group of local men it seemed with their weapons at the ready as if they were ready to attack.</p>
				<p>"Ready your bows!" shouted the captain.</p>
				<p>Before anyone else had the chance to ready their bow, Ingrid had hers out and ready to fire. They fired their first round of arrows as they landed on the beach then quickly fired a second round before disembarkiung and rushing up the beach to fight them in hand on hand combat. Eventually the local men fell. One man managed to escape nearly unnoticed other than the eyes of Ingrid. Before she could tell anyone she had to make a choice, shoot the man with an arrow, although she did hate to kill, or let the man flee.</p>
