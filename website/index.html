			<div class="grid-item"><h1>The Wizard</h1><p>The wizard comes from a village further inland but has heard about the oppurtunity of sailing away to locate a treasure which would tell him all the secrets of magic he wishes to know. Eugene the Enchanted has a darker side which he tries to hide, unlike other wizards in the land, he enjoys to kill and likes to use his magic for darker uses. He believes on his journey he can find an acient book whihc will allow him to resurect the dead, after killing his lover in a drunken rage he seeks to bring her back.</p></div>
			<div class="grid-item"><h1>The Warrior</h1><p>The warrior, a huge viking, some saying the strongest and bravest viking in all of the land, travelled across land and sea to Trondheim to find a vessle great enough to take him the rest of his journey to find riches he can only imagine. Ulfrik the huge carries a mighty axe which is said to be sharp enough to slice through the thickest of armour just from looking at it for too long, but it this blade enough to carry him through his journeys?</p></div>
			<div class="grid-item"><h1>The Archer</h1><p>The archer grew up in Trondheim as a poor farmers daughter, but spent her days creating bows from fallen branches and string she found around her house, she used stone and smaller branches to create arrows and hunted for food all her life so her family could eat each night. Ingrid the Eagle eye has known nothing but hardship her whole life being treated like scum from such a young age due to the family she came from. No longer will she endure this, stories have been told of a town where she can sneak on to a ship and sail away to find a reason to become something more than what she already is.</p></div>
