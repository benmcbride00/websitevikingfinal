				<p>Ulfrik the huge was known throughout the land for his huge stature and his mighty strength with many people saying he was the strongest man in all the land, he had never met anyone bigger or stronger than himself. Ulfrik was travelling to Trondheim to start his travels to a far away land he had heard rumours about, England, but he needed a crew to do so.</p>
				<p>He had sent out word that he would be holding a contest in Trondheim to pick a crew, he would pick the 10 strongest and bravest men from everyone who entered. When he arrived in Trondheim he soon realised that many people had travelled for this competition as everyone wanted to be in this mighty mans crew.</p>
				<p>Before the competition could start he had to rest and stayed in a local inn the night before. Early the next morning the competition started and quickly it finished and he was able to decide on the 10 men he would bring with him on his journey</p>
				<p>"Perfect that is the crew chosen!" he shouted in a deep voice</p>
				<p>Although, he quickly realised that one of the men had cheated to be in the crew, now he had a decision to make, does he keep the man in his crew but risk him being a problem or does he get rid of the man and bring someone else who wasn't smart enough to beat the cheating man.</p>
