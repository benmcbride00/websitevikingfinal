				<p>"Lets stand and fight my friends" shouted Eugene</p>
				<p>Eugene and his convoy stood and fought the beast, the battle between the two raged on for hours, neither landing a deadly blow. Eugene tried different deadly spells but none of whihc seemed to have any effect on the beast.
				He seemed to be immune to many of the attacks Eugene used on the beast.</p>
				<p>While this battle was raging on the army from the town was approaching closer and closer and where within eyeshot of the beast. Once the army caught the beats eyes, it lept forward to attack the army head on and immediately killed many of the men in the army.
				Quickly the numbers in the army started to fall under the attack from the beast and Eugene and his convoy. Eventually all that was left was Eugene the best, the town wizard and a few of his soldiers. Eventaully the best fell before them all. Eugene was left to fend off the rest of the army on his own.
				Even if he did manage to fend them off how would he be able to finish his quest on his own, he couldn't.</p>
				<p>"Surrender Eugene!" shouted the towns wizard.</p>
				<p>Eugene took a minute to decide what he was to do, on one hand he could surrender and fail his quest but possibly end up in prison for the rest of his life, or he could try and fight but risk death as he was heavily out numbered.</p>
				<p>"I surrender." shouted Eugene back.</p>
