				<p>"Kill the men!" Ulfrik shouted</p>
				<p>His men obeyed without hesitation and before the men on the beach had a chance to defend themselves Ulfrik and his men had thrown spears and shot arrows at the men and killed them all.
				They continued further to the the village where they saw a sign which read "No Vistors welcome!" in the native tongue of this land, they continued into the village and destroyed it klilling everyone in their path and taking all the valuables they could find for themselves.
				While here they found a treasure map which seemed to lead them to an area not far from where they where, this must have been what Ulfrik was looking for, these where the riches he was after and had heard about all his life.</p>
				<p>"Follow the map" said Ulfrik</p>
				<p>Ulfrik lead his men in the direction the map was telling them to shortly after they encountered the area the map directed them to, although there where two passage ways, one leading left and the other right. Which passage way do the men take, thought Ulfrik.</p>
				<p>They decided to camp at the entrance for the night so that they could rest as they didn't know what lay ahead on their journey.</p>
				<p>They woke the next morning and Ulfrik had to decide which way does he go left or right</p>
