				<p>Ingrid hides below deck so that the kraken can't see her. One of the crew members pulls out his sword and attacks the kraken slicing off the tenticle which is holding the captain. The rest of the crew then join in on the attack and kill the kraken before it can do any more damage to the boat</p>
				<p>"Where's Ingrid?", asked the captain.</p>
				<p>Ingrid pops her head up from below deck and everyone turns and looks and notices that Ingrid hid below deck</p>
				<p>"Coward!" shouts one of the crew members </p>
				<p>The crew branded Ingrid a coward for hiding below deck when everyone else fought. The ship sailed on though and eventually got to England, as soon as they got there they found the local town and ransacked it taking everything they could. That night they camped just outside of the town, three of the men snuck up on Ingrids tent and tied her up before she had a chance to defend herself. The three men carried Ingrid on a horse and took her to the nearest town where they sold her off to a local man as a slave branded with a 'C' for coward.</p>
