				<p>Eugene send a rod of lightening from his hand and kills the fleeing man.</p>
				<p>"Why did you do that?" Asks one of the companions.</p>
				<p>"To stop him from telling the rest of the village about us, or we'd have a whole army after us! Now lets continue." repolied Eugene in a very satisfied voice.</p>
				<p>The convoy continued into the dark forest. There had been stories about this forest they had been told growing up, about monsters and creatures whihc where bigger than what you could imagine.
				Some of the companions shivered with fear but it didn't stop them from continuing on as they were more afraid of what Eugene could do to them if they fled. Shortly down the path it came to an end and they had to continue
				travelling through the forest without a path, cutting down hanging bracnhes adn brambles which got in their way.</p>
				<p>"Stop!" Shouted Eugene.</p>
				<p>"What is it?" asked Morris.</p>
				<p>"I Heard something. I think we should set up camp here for the night." said Eugene.</p>
				<p>Camp was set up and again Eugene made food for the convoy to ensure everyone was well fed for the days ahead. The next day the convoy approached the town where they would set sail from.
				They had sent a small group ahead to buy a boat and to ensure that it was ready to set sail as soon as they arrived, they didn't like to wait around in towns and villages as many people has a sour taste towards them.
				As they arrived in the town one of the men, Norris, was waiting for the convoy to direct them to the ship so that they could set sail immediately.
				After a week of sailing one of the men in Eugene's convoy grew sick and was starting to show signs of death, Eugene had to think of what he had to do, should he try to heal the man and risk sending the man insane with him possibly killing more of the convoy, or should he ease the mans last moments and speed the process up with a spell which would kill the man quicker.
