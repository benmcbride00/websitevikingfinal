				<p>Ingrid had finally had enough, she had lived her life as a peasent and was sick of it. Everyone she had ever met had looked down upon here and she had finally had enough. Ingrid had spoken to her father and told him of her plans to leave and try and make a life for herself, he hadn't liked the idea at first but had started to come round to it, after all she is a fantastic archer, one of the best in the town in fact.</p>
				<p>"Today is the day father, I must leave today." said Ingrid</p>
				<p>"Okay, if you must, you will always have a home here though" replied her father</p>
				<p>Ingrid set of on her travels early that morning on one of the horses her father had saved up and bought for her when she was younger. She took with her a quiver of arrows and a bow she had made, a knife her father had given her passed down through the genrations of their family and some supplies for her journey. She set off to go south towards a town she had heard about which set people of on journeys to find land south.</p>
				<p>After 7 days of travelling she finally arrived at the town she had heard about, it was even grander than she had heard, the houses where bigger than she had imagined and everyone seemed so friendly. Best of all noone looked down upon her. She went searching for the docks and later that day she finally found them, there were also people standing beside the boots doing what seemed to be signing people up for their journeys. This was it she finally had a chance to leave. Ingrid made her way over to the mena dn started talking to them and found out that the two boots where going to different places but she had to make a choice on which boot she wanted to go on. One boat was going towards a land called England where she could expect mighty riches and land for herself and her family, and the other boat was going to a far away land in search of men who had recently disappeard where she would be rewarded in her home land with riches and respect but there was a higher chance of death as they had never ventured to this land before.</p>
