Her next move was to qucikly draw her bow and shot an arrow into the head of the beast, then when it turned to attack Ingrid she dropped her bow and pulled her sword out stabbing the creating in the head before it had a chance to attack her killing it before it could do any more damage. The rest of the crew watched her in shock, none of them could believe what had just happened.</p>
				<p>"Thank you, you saved my life" said the captain.</p>
				<p>"No worries, I had to help." laughed Ingrid</p>
