				<p>Ingrid decided to go on the boat to England, she felt like that would be safer than travelling to a far off land noone had been to before and one that had taken men from their land.</p>
				<p>Before they set off the crew where given a day to rest up and get any supplies they needed before leaving at first light the next morning. The next morning came and Ingrid had her supplies ready to leave, she had been given a small sword by the leader of the crew as he noticed she didnt have one. Ingrid was actually very handy with a sword as she trained with some of the local boys when she was younger and had taught herself how to use the sword well.</p>
				<p>They set off on their journey, noone expected their to be a girl in their crew and many of the men made jokes that she would die within a week but she was determined to prove them all wrong and to get back to prove to her town that she should be respected. After 3 days on the boot the crew started to her a noise, they had heard about a beast which roamed these parts of the seas but they had believed they were just stories. They had no way to know if this was the beast so they all hoped it was just thunder in the distance.
				As the noise grew louder and closer to the boat though they realised that it couldn't have been thunder.</p>
				<p>All of a sudden everything went silent, then a huge Kraken burst out of the water sending the boat flying back</p>
				<p>"Everyone up, everyone get ready to fight!" shouted the captain.</p>
				<p>Everyone jumped up ready to fight and Ingrid readied her bow to shoot at the kraken before it could make another move. She let loose an arrow which hit the beat in one of its 8 eyes. Suddenly the beast shot foward toward the boat and hit the captain of the boat with one of its tenticles before grabbing him with another.</p>
				<p>what should I do she thought, should I hide, or should I help the captain.</p>
