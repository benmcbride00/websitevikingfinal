				<p>Ulfrik decides to take his crew to the right, unsure of where the passageway leads but similar to the left one it is well lit. The passageway seems to end very quickly whihc they were surprised at. It takes them to a small village of people who look very surprised to see them.</p>
				<p>They are approached by the village people who seem to speak their tongue and explain to them that they too had come on search of mighty treasure some moons ago but had taken the right passageway and ended up finding this small village where they could have all the food and drink they wanted but once they left they could only bring with them the sets of armour in the center of the village and nothing more. If they stayed they would be full forever and the women of the village would treat them like kings but they could take none of this with them if they were to leave</p>
				<p>"would you stay?" asked one of the village people.</p>
				<p>Ulfrik was unsure what to do but he had pleged to return home to tell the people of the town what they had found and share the riches with the poeple who had followed him all his life.</p>
				<p>They decided to stay and rest for 2 nights and 2 days and enjoy the comfort of the village with all the food they could eat and all the drink they could imagine. After the two days they returned to their ships with the armour and weapons they had been given by the village people, the armour was the best they had ever seen and were proud of it but disappointed they couldn't have found more riches to bring home with them.</p>
