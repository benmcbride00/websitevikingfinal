				<p>Ingrid let the man flee claiming to everyone that she didn't see him till it was too late, luckily everyone believed her as noone else had seen him till it was too late either.</p>
				<p>They continued forward in the hope that the village the man ran too didn't have any other men waiting for them. As they approached the village they saw signs to warn them away along wiht skeletons hanging from trees to try and scare them away. They couldn't see much life around the village so they continued into it cautiously in the hope that noone was there.</p>
				<p>When they got into the village they quickly found the bodies of the men they had been looking for brutally murdered lying on the ground. They turned to leave in horror having found what they came for, but before they could leave the exists where slammed shout with one being left open and the rest of the village men marching through it with their weapons at the ready. Before they could ready themselves a wave of arrows came flying over the wall and hit the crew killing 5 of them.
				9 men and Ingrid were left to fight the rest of the army, they were outnumbered 5 - 1. They allowed the village men to walk closer to them before they started firing arrows back at them then charged at them to catch them off guard. The village men were well trained and manged to ready their spears to stop the run of the men killing another 3 of them. Before they realised it the crew were surronded and all the men left were slaughtered by the village people leaving Ingrid alive and taking her captive and allowing the men of the village alone time with her one after another.
				</p><p>Ingrid tried to endure this so she could escape but eventually she gave up and eventually died at the hands of the men</p>
