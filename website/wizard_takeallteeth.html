				<p>Eugene devoured all the teeth from the serpent, as he devoured the last one he seemed to shreik in pain and a bolt of darkness erupted from his body and abruptly disappeared. When he rose again around his eyes were black as if he hadn't slept in weeks, his eyes has changed to a red colour and he looked incredibly evil it was hard to tell who he was. </p>
				<p>Norris looked at him in shock and cautiously asked "Eugene what has happened are you okay?"</p>
				<p>"I've never felt better!" replied Eugene with a snarl on his face</p>
				<p>Eugene then killed the rest of his convoy out of the anger he felt inside, killing them felt amazing and give him the strength to carry on. While he was doing this he hadn't realised that the reamins of the boat he had been standing on had drifted to the island he was looking for.
				This was perfect for him, he was at his destination and he didnt have to share in spoils with anyone else. He continued to travel through the forest on this island destroying every living creature in his way, until he came to a cave entrance. This is were he needed to be he could feel it.
				Eugene sent a fireball flying through the cave to light it up to see if there was anythign there, there wasn't.</p>
				<p>"Perfect!" exclaimed Eugene.</p>
				<p>He continued through the strangely dry cave, there didn't seem to be any living creatures but there were lots of bones and remains laying about. The Question was where did they come from?</p>
				<p>Eugene continued into the cave until he came to a large boulder whihc seemed to be covering a door way. He wasn't strong enough to move it so he decided to blow it up using magic. As the smoke started to clear from the explosion he noticed there was a glow from inside the room.</p>
				<p>"This must be it." He thought, "I've finally found it!"</p>
				<p>When the smoke finally cleared he noticed skeletons whihc seemed to be alive start to rise from the ground. They seemed to be guarding something at the other side of the room. The skeletons started making their way towards Eugene, with their swords in their hands. Eugene wasn't sure if they could be killed as they were already dead, but he decided to shoot
				a bolt of fire at them in the hope it would explode them. He had no luck instead the fire just brushed off them in different directions. As they got closer he decided he didn't have many other options other than to conjour a sword and fight the skeletons. Fortunately the sword he conjoured was a mighty sword and was able to cut through the bones of the skeletons very quickly and easily leaving a rubble of bones behind.
				</p><p>Eugene was now left to read the book he had so long sought after. As he opened it he felt a huge relief sweep over him and then sudden sorrow. His sould had been returned to him by the book but now the sorrow of killing all his convoy had set in. Eugene read the book in tears and realised there was no way to bring back his dead lover but there were tecahings on how to become the strongest wizard in the world.
				Eugene decided to stay on this derlict Island instead of retunring home and telling everyone of his sorrows and woes, he lived sad and depressed but built a mighty castle and offered any lost travellers refuge and teachings into magic so that he could pass on his knowledge in the hope that people may use it for good unlike him.</p>
