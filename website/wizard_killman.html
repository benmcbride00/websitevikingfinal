				<p>Eugene used a spell to kill the man, although he got  akick from killing people this was different, he had to kill a friend which really messed with his head. He had to do it, he kept telling himself this. If he hadn't the man may have gone crazy and killed the rest of them or the disease may have spread to the others.
				</p><p>"Did you have to kill him?" Asked Morris.</p>
				<p>"There was no there way. The disease woulda killed us all." replies Eugene.</p>
				<p>"Could you not have healed him?" Asked Norris.</p>
				<p>"I dont have the knowledge to do that properly, he would have likely gone crazy and killed us all." Said Eugene in a depressed voice.</p>
				<p>This was something that would mess with him for the rest of their journey, it was something he could never really get over, it reminded him of how he killed his lover, but he had to continue on if he were to right his wrong doings.
				</p>
				<p>Eugene hated to sail but after a week of sialing he knew they were nearly at their destination, although something didnt seem right. The water had been churning and the waves were getting larger, thunder started to roar and the cries of sailers could be heard in the distance.</p>
				<p>What was it? He wondered, it didn't sound good whatever it was, he just hoped it wasn't coming from the direction they were going.</p>
				<p>"Something doesn't feel right."Said Norris in a trembling voice, "Did anyone hear those cries."</p>
				<p>"Yeah, something is wrong we need to be ready for anything." replied Morris in an equally trembling voice.</p>
				<p>Before they could prepare themselves anymore there was a mighty roar and a huge serpent came flying out of the sea. It was the world serpent, Eugene had only heard about it in stories but had never really paid attention as he didn't believe it was real. Fortunately, Norris had remembered a story his father had told him when he was younger.
				</p><p>"The world serpent has mighty teeth which can are extremely valuable to a wizard they can be used to strengthen their powers but come at a great cost, they devour your soul, the more teeth you take the more of your soul is lost and the less you become yourself. Serpents are extremely hard to kill they can only be killed by a spear through the soft part of their eye, nothing else will penetrate the skin" echoed Norris' fathers words in his mind.</p>
				<p>"Through the eye!" Norris exclaimed, "Hit him with a spear in the eye, its the only way he can die."</p>
				<p> Eugene aimed a spear using magic it levitated slightly above his hand before he let loose. Before he could throw the spear the serpent slammed itself down onto the boat breaking it in half and killing half of the convoy along with Morris and the leader of the convoy.
				With anger taking over Eugene let loose his spear. The spear lodged itself right in the left eye of the serpent. With a mighty roar the serpent dropped onto the boat. Norris explained what he remembered from the stroy his father had told him.</p>
				<p> Eugene had to decide, how many teeth does he take, he needs to be stronger but how much stronger, and at what cost?</p>
