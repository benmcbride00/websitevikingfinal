				<p>Ulfrik decides to keep the man in his crew, after all if he was smart enough to outsmart Ulfrik and the rest of the men there competing he must be a very good asset to have in his crew.
				Shortly after deciding the crew, they left via boat for a far away land known as England, noone was entirely sure if England actually existed but Ulfrik was sure they would find somewhere.</p>
				<p>Days passed and they hadn't seen or heard anything, where they definitely going in the correct direction, thought Ulfrik, surely it wouldn't take this long to get to the new land. They hadn't even seen another boat or any sign that life had passed through this location.</p>
				<p>More days passed and still they hadn't seen anything, until eventually they started to see land in the distance, they had done it they had found England or so they thought. When they landed they were met with a group of men with barely any clothes on, they weren't quite sure who they were but they had weapons in their hands ready to fight if they needed to.</p>
				<p>"Get ready to fight!" said Ulfrik</p>
				<p>"No sir let me talk to them I think I know how to communicate with them." said the man who cheated.</p>
				<p>"Okay try and talk to them but I cannot promise we won't kill them." replied Ulfrik.</p>
				<p>The man who cheated went and talked with the local men who told him they weren't in fact in England and that they didn't know where that was but could come back to their camp where they would be fed and helped out. Ulfrik wasn't a man to seek help from people he didn't know or truest so he had a decision to make.
				He was still toying with the idea to kill these men and ransack their village or to go back to their village with them and enjoy their hospitality.</p>
